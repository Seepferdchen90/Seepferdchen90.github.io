This website will be about the broader topic of the reception and representation of Buddhism and Hinduism in videogames.
The main focus lies on two case studies, Cyberpunk 2077 and Far Cry 4. Both games were analysed and researched in a small case studie in a Blockseminar during my research in religious studies.
Since the topic involves the research of digital media and falls in the broader case of digital humanities, I will use this way of presenting my results.
