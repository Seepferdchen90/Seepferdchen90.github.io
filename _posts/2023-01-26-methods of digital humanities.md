title: Methods of Digital Humanities-a small case studies
categories: [digital humanities]
---

This post is a short review or conclusion of the small case studie I worked on in the course "Digitale Forschungsmethoden" in the Wintersemester 2022/2023. I used one of the methods that we have discussed and were teached in the seminar. More precisely I did a websraping of one blog on Popular Culture and Religion and than started a small textual analysis of the blog entries. 
# Webscraping a Blog

I started with a general research on blogs about religion and videogames. My first idea was actually to look at discussion about religion and buddhism in videogames in some reddit discussions. But because of the small timeframe of the seminar and other obligations I had not enough time to take a closer lokk into ways and methods for websrcaping a reddit post or discussion. My experiences here are either that I got offered to by programms which would automatically scrape this post for me, or I would have needed a lot more knowledge or experience in programming languages. Therefore I decided to use a more accessible website or blog as a case studie. Another problem that I came across in my research was that there are not so much blogs about religion and videogames, beside the ones regarding christianity and videogames, to be found. And if one can find a blogpost about the topic, there could only be found in differente blogs, so that a webscraping would have been not useful, because there I could just copy and past the entries in a table. 
# Blog: Popular Culture and Religion

The blog I found deals with the topic of theological discourse on popular culture. The blog _Pop Culture and Theology_ [](https://popularcultureandtheology.com/) has entries on differnt media of popular culture, like movies, series, comic books and music, which the authors discuss in the context of theology. It is based on the Popular Culture and Philosophy series from either Open Court Publishing or Blackwell. And beside blogpost about differente medias and the topic of religion from atheological point of view there are a lot of _call for papers_ in the blog. 
# Methods for case studie
## Open Refine

Since we have used the program open refine in the course of the seminar for different exercises I also used this program for my little project. The main goal here for me was to get the main information (like date and time, author of the blog entries) and especially the textual context of the blog posts. 
Since we already had a little introduction to the program and had done some practical exercises with it, I did know what I had to do. And together with a small video guide we had for webscraping via open refine I did manage to scrape the information I needed at the end. 
But there were of course also some problems involveld. One of the major problems was to adjust the given instructions into a format that is working also for the specific blog I choose. But after some try and errors I was able to get all the informtaion that I needed.
## AntCon

For the further use of the information I gathered in open refine ans to use it in the program Antcon to do a text analysis of the blog post, they had first to be put and saved in the right format. For this I needed some help and with the right instruction code it was quite easy. But in contrast to the rather easy use of open refine this part requested some more specific knowledge of programming language. This was therefore a step which is not possible without any instructions or advise. 
After the files were stored in the right format the use of AntCon was quite easy. The only thing that is necessary is a research question. This part has best to be done before the search for information. Because of the small timeframe and the requirements of the task in the seminar I did not phrase a research question before hand. Because the main goal as far as I got it was to get more experience in the use of digital tools rather then a specific reaseach topic. 
Because of that I started a small more general textual analyses of the blog. 

# Results or Conclusion

The use of webscarping tools and methods for the reasearch can be very fruitful, although it requires at least some basic understanding of the tools and methods. Especially for the analyses of large data sets, like blog post or social media posts it makes the gathering of data and the interpretation and anaylses of the data much more easier and quicker. 
After some time getting used to the tool I was able to get the information I needed from the blog and could then also use them for a anaylse of the blogposts. 
For a more detailed and bigger research topic with a great amount of data that has to be collected and further processed tools like open refine and AntCon can be very helpful. Especially in regard of time and analysis.
