title: Methods of Digital Humanities-A Small Case Studies
categories: [digital humanities]
---

This post is a short review or conclusion of the small case studie I worked on in the course "Digitale Forschungsmethoden" in the Wintersemester  of 2022/2023. I used one of the methods that we have discussed in the seminar to webscrape information from a blog on Popular Culture and Religion to do a small textual anlysis on the entries of the blog.
# Webscraping a Blog

I started with a general research on blogs about religion and videogames. My first idea was actually to look at discussions or forum entries about religion and buddhism in videogames on [_reddit_](https://www.reddit.com/). But because of the limited timeframe of the seminar I had not enough time to take a closer lokk into ways and methods for websrcaping a reddit post or discussion. Because this also required the use of other methods or programs for webscraping that we did not discuss in the seminar and a more specifc knowledge of programming language. Therefore I decided to use a more accessible website or blog as a case studie. 
Another problem that I came across in my research was that there are not so much blogs about religion and videogames, beside the ones regarding christianity and videogames, to be found. And if one can find a blogpost about the topic, there could only be found in differente blogs, so that a webscraping would have been not useful, because there I could just copy and past the entries in a table. 
# Blog: Popular Culture and Religion

The blog I found deals with the topic of theological discourse on popular culture. The blog [_Pop Culture and Theology_](https://popularcultureandtheology.com/) has entries on differnt media of popular culture, like movies, series, comic books and music, which the authors discuss in the context of theology. It is based on the Popular Culture and Philosophy series from either Open Court Publishing or Blackwell. And beside blogpost about different types of media and the topic of religion from a theological point of view there are a lot of _call for papers_ in the blog. 
# Methods for case studie
## Open Refine

Since we have used the program [_open refine_](https://openrefine.org/) in the course of the seminar for different exercises I also used this program for my project. The main goal here for me was to get the main information (like date and time, author of the blog entries) and especially the textual context of the blog posts. And to get some more practices in the use of the program for webscraping. 
Since we already had a little introduction to the program and had done some practical exercises with it, I baiscally did know what I had to do. And together with a small video guide we had for webscraping via open refine I did manage to scrape the information I needed at the end. 
But there were of course also some problems. One of the major problems was to adjust the given instructions into a format that is working also for the specific blog I choose. Another problem for me was that it took me more time then I expected. But in the end I was able to get all the information I needed to get a step further in the quest for doing a textual anlysis of the blog entries.
## AntCon

For the further use of the information I gathered in open refine and to use it for a text analysis of the blog post I needed another program that was also introduced in the seminar. But to use the information in [_Antcon_](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/) I first had to put and save them in the right format. For this I needed some help and with the right instruction it was quite easy. But in contrast to the rather easy use of open refine this part requested some more specific knowledge of programming language. This was therefore a step which is not possible without any instructions or basic knowledge of some programming language. 
After the files were stored in the right format the use of AntCon was easy. The only thing that is necessary is of course a specific research question. This part has best to be done before the search for information. Because of the small timeframe and the requirements of the task in the seminar I did not phrase a research question before hand. Because the main goal for this small exercise for me was to get more experience in the use of digital tools rather then a specific research topic.

# Conclusion

In general this small exercise in webscraping a blog and playing with the tool for textual analysis together with the methods and practices I were introduced in the seminar made me aware of a lot of possibilities in regard of digital tool for the field of humanities and especially for religious studies. The use of webscraping tools and methods for the research can be very fruitful, although it requires at least some basic understanding of the tools and methods that will be used. Especially for the analyses of large data sets, like blog post or social media posts it makes the gathering of data and the interpretation and anaylses of the data much more easier and quicker. The two used programs open refine and Antcon were both very helpful and especially the first is good to work with, because of a lot of further information and instructions that can be found online.
It is therefore worth at least considering the use of digital tools for research studies and in the teaching of religious studies. I at least will absolutely use one or two of the discussed methods or tools in the futur.
