This is the start of the blog and the first entry on this website.
This blog will be written to show the results of a small case studie about Buddhism and Hinduism in videogames in religious studies.
<!--more-->
Buddhism and Hinduism as of today are two big `religions` of the world. The reception and representation of both religions and practices coonected with them consits of a great number of different forms and media.
All of those representations differ from cultural context and religious background. 

# Digital Buddhism and Hinduism

Digital media like any other type of media can have an influence on the practices and the representation of religion. Hence, digital media also shape and influence the way in which religion, in that case Buddhism and Hinduism is shown and represented.
But to what extant does this happen? How does the depition of Buddhism and Hinduism is influenced by the use of digital media? This an more questions will be addressed in the following bog post on this site.
The focus lies here on the representation and receptionof Buddhism and Hinduism in videogames, more precisely in the video games _Far Cry 4_ and _Cyberpunk 2077_.
Both games give a specific angle for the study of Buddhism and Hinduism in videogames. 
## Cyberpunk 2077

[Cyberpunk 2077] (https://www.cyberpunk.net/us/en/) made by CD Project Red in December 2020 is an open-world action roleplay set in the Cyberpunk universe. It is based on the world and lore of the Pen and Paper roleplay _Cyberpunk 2020_.
### Religion in Cyberpunk 2077
Religion plays not a big part in the main story of the game. Although that depens on the definition which will be used for the concept of religion. But there are some sidequest in which the player interacts with NPC's in the context of religion.
<p/>There are two quests in which Buddhism plays a part in the game. The first one is a sidequest in which the player encounters one buddhist monk on the street, who asks him for help. Like many other figures in the _Cyberpunk 2077_ universe he has adjustments of body parts and wears a lot of cyberware. He claims that he was forced to do them and that his friend is in great danger to also be forced to do that. 
The player can choose to rescue the other monk in different ways, although the monk request to solve the problem without using violence. After you rescued the other monk you can encounter the two monks later in the game. There you can ask them about the question of the soul and if a costruct also can have a soul.
<p/>The second questline in which the player encounters Buddhism in the game is when he meets a monk on a parkbench in the park of _Nightcity_. The monk offers the player to guide him through a meditation via a Braindance. When the player accepts this quest he will be guided by the monk through a series of meditations, which all focusing on  a different element (nature/wood, water, fire and air). 
Both questlines take specific features of Buddhist practices and represent them in a way which represent common known features of Buddhism in the west. The focus on non-violence, meditation and the background of reincarnation.

## Far Cry 4

The second game, _Far Cry 4_ is an open-world ego-shooter which is set in an imaginary place of _Kyrat_. Which is based on the place of Nepal. This place shows different cultural and religious features of the real region. 
In regard of the religion which is depicted in the game, one can speak of a mixture of Buddhist and Hinduist elements, which were mixed together to show a specific view of the cultural context and religions. 
The question here is which features are used to depict a fictive religion in a videogame?

# What to come
- The first step to represent the case studies done is the presentation of the methodological and theoretical background of religion and videogames 
- After that there will be separate post for both case studies 
- And at the end the presentation of the results and further questions
